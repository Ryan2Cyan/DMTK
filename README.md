# Dungeon Master's Toolkit (DMTK)
Digital Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) tabletop simulation software aiming to replicate the basic functions and traditional </br>
benefits of a real-world tabletop and miniatures. Primary goals include: (1) simplistic user interface, and (2) supplementary </br>
approach. </br>
Made in the Unity game engine. </br>
Submitted as final year project at Bournemouth University (2024). </br>
